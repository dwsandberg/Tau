/section Tau Install Instruction

Install command line tools for Mac OS ,if not already installed.

Down load zip file from GitHub

Unzip to directory a which we will call <Tau>.  This directory will become the working directory for tau.    You are free to choose another name.  

Open Terminal and cd to Tau

Run "bash bin/install".  This is likely to generate a warning message about the llvm spec. 

Modify PATH environment variable to include absolute path to <Tau>/bin. 


/section HelloWorld

1. Create a new directory <Tau>/HelloWorld

2. Create a file txt file <Tau>/HelloWorld/HelloWorld.ls that contains:

/keyword Library HelloWorld   use stdlib  exports HelloWorld

Module HelloWorld

use standard 


Function entrypoint(args:UTF8) UTF8 HTMLformat."Hello World"

3. From terminal run: /< block tau  stdlib HelloWorld arg />

This will create a file <tau>/tmp/stdlib.html and open the file in a browser. 

In this command /em tau refers to a script in <tau>/bin/tau.  The next word, /em stdlib 
, refers to a dynamic library <tau>/stdlib.dylib which tau will load 
and pass the rest of the command line as an argument to stdlib. 

The library stdlib takes /em "HelloWorld" and creates another dynamic library <tau>/Helloworld.dylib
from the src in <tau>/HelloWorld/HelloWorld.ls.  Helloworld.dylib is then loaded and
the entrypoint function is call with any remaining arguments, which in this case is "arg"
If no args are present, then execute stops with the creation of HelloWorld.dylib.

Once HelloWorld.dylib is created, the program can be run with
/< block tau  HelloWorld arg /> without any compiling taking place.

One can direct the output to a file with
/< block tau -f file.html HelloWorld arg />

4. Many text editors allow scripts to be run.  To change HelloWorld into a script
add as the first line  of the  HelloWorld.ls,  the line
/< block #!/bin/sh  tau stdlib  HelloWorld /> followed by a blank line. 
Your text editor may run HelloWorld as a script without setting the execute bit. 
To set the execute bit, use /< block chmod +x HelloWorld/HelloWorld.ls />
