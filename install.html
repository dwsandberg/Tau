<h2> Installing Tau </h2> 
<p> Make sure clang is installed. For Mac OS Clang is available if the command line tools are installed.
<p> Down load zip file from GitHub(Repository is dwsandberg/Tau
<p> Unzip to directory a which we will call &lt;Tau>. This directory will become the working directory for tau. You are free to choose another name. 
<p> Modify PATH environment variable to include absolute path to &lt;Tau>/bin. 
<p> Open terminal and change direcotry to &lt;Tau>.
<p> Run"bash bin/installtau". This is likely to generate a warning message about the llvm spec. 
<p>
<h2> HelloWorld </h2> 
<p> 1. Create a new directory &lt;Tau>/HelloWorld
<p> 2. Create a file txt file &lt;Tau>/HelloWorld/HelloWorld.ls that contains:
<p> <span class=keyword> Library </span> HelloWorld uses stdlib exports HelloWorld
<p> <span class=keyword> Module </span> HelloWorld
<p> <span class=keyword> use </span> format
<p> <span class=keyword> use </span> standard
<p> <span class=keyword> Function </span> entrypoint(args:UTF8)UTF8 HTMLformat.<span class=literal >"Hello World!"</span> 
<p> 3. From terminal run:<span class=block> tau stdlib HelloWorld x </span> 
<p> This will create a program with the name of HelloWord from the source code in directory &lt;tau>/HelloWorld. Since another argument is present in this case"x", the program Helloworld will be ran with the remaining arguments and open a web browser with the results.
<p> If"x"was not present then Helloworld would not be ran and a message displayed indicating the program was successfully created. 
<p> HelloWorld can now be run from the prompt:<span class=block> tau HelloWord </span> This will display"Hello World!"in the web browser. 
<p>
<h2> HelloWorld with dynamic libraries </h2> The Mac OS X implementation also allows dynamic libraries to be created instead of programs.The command is <span class=block> ltau stdlib HelloWorld x </span> 
<p> In this command <em> ltau </em> refers to a script in &lt;tau>/bin. The next word, <em> stdlib </em>, refers to a dynamic library &lt;tau>/stdlib.dylib which tau will load and pass the rest of the command line as an argument to stdlib. 
<p> The library stdlib takes <em>"</em> HelloWorld"and creates another dynamic library &lt;tau>/Helloworld.dylib from the src in &lt;tau>/HelloWorld. Helloworld.dylib is then loaded and the entrypoint function is call with any remaining arguments, which in this case is"x"If no args are present, then execute stops with the creation of HelloWorld.dylib.
<p> Once HelloWorld.dylib is created, the program can be run with <span class=block> ltau HelloWorld arg </span> without any compiling taking place.
<p> 4. Many text editors allow scripts to be run. To change HelloWorld into a script add as the first line of the HelloWorld.ls, the line <span class=block> #!/bin/sh tau stdlib HelloWorld </span> followed by a blank line. Your text editor may run HelloWorld as a script without setting the execute bit. To set the execute bit, use <span class=block> chmod+x HelloWorld/HelloWorld.ls </span> 
<p>
<h2> Installing Web Assembly Cross Compiler </h2> 
<p> Since wasm files cannot be served from filesystem a web server is required. OSX has an Apache web server pre-installed. The details of how to configure the Apache web server is not hard but the details vary with OS so only the gist of what needs to be done is given here.
<p> Set up a virtual host Below is an example configuretion. The quotes strings will need to be updated with absolute path of you &lt;Tau> directory.<span class=block> &lt;VirtualHost *:80> ServerName myhost.local
<br> DocumentRoot"/Users/david/Tau"
<br> &lt;Directory"/Users/david/Tau"> <span class=block> Options FollowSymLinks Multiviews
<br> MultiviewsMatch Any
<br> AllowOverride None
<br> Require all granted </span> &lt;/Directory>
<br> ScriptAliasMatch^/cgi-bin/((?!(?i:webobjects)).*$)"/Users/david/Tau/bin/$1"
<br> ErrorLog"/private/var/log/apache2/myhost-error_log"
<br> CustomLog"/private/var/log/apache2/myhost-access_log"common
<br> &lt;/VirtualHost> </span> 
<p> To avoid file permission problems add the group of the web server as one of your groups. Make that you default group.Change the user to your user name to avoid permission problems.An alternative is to run the web server under you user.
<p> Since files are cached by browse change cache control to retrieve new copy when file is changed on server. To do this add the directive <span class=block> set Cache-Control no-cache </span> to the &lt;IfModule headers_module> section of the configuration file.
<p> The &lt;Tau>/bin/putfile.cgi is needed to write files back to the server.
<p> Restart the Apache web server. 
<p> To see if all is working properly run the command <span class=block> wtau wtests wtests </span> This should open a web browser with page with a button. Push the button to run the test. All the test should pass.
