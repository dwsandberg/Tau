<h1 > Tau: An Experimental Programm Language </h1>

 <p > Programming language today look pretty much the same as they did 30 years ago. 
 Today they may have few more features are not substancaly better as a notation for thought. 
 I have created another programming language in attempt to introduce a new way to think about 
 programming which attempts to make a leap forward. The language has  
 <br>  No assignment operator. 
 <br>No loop/while/do statement 
 <br>No function type.
 <br>Only uses program state in a very controlled way. 
 <br>Words are the basic text element instead of characters. 
 <br>heavy use of sequences. 
 <br>introduces a new control structure modeled after the sigma operator in mathematics. </p> 

<p>Read more about it at 
<a href="taudoc.html"> tau Language Reference </a>.</p>

<p> Only runs on Mac OS X. To get running code:

<br> move stdlib.bc to a working directory and make subdirectories in Github subdirectories of the working directory.  (Symbolic links work) 

<br> cc -dynamiclib stdlib.bc  -o stdlib.dylib  -init _init22 -undefined dynamic_lookup

<br> cc stdlib/*.c -o taumain

<br> ./taumain testall testall testall

<br> will produce test.html file.
